# Bitbotter

My own custom scripts used to automate Bitburner. This repo uses the official Typescript/Javascript template provided [here](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template) as a base.

This means you can either use the scripts directly, or synchronize with Bitburner.

## Contents

Below is the list of folders and the type of scripts contained within it. You can skip folders if you haven't reached that BN yet and want to avoid spoilers.
